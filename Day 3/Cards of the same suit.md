You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

$$First Draw = \frac{13}{52}$$

$$Second Draw \frac{12}{51}$$

$$ (\frac{13}{52} * \frac{12}{51}) = \frac{3}{51} $$

This is the output for single suit. So **multiply it with 4**

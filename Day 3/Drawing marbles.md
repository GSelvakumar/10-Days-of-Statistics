A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Total = 3 + 4 = 7

$$Probability(Red) = \frac{3}{7}$$

$$Probability(Blue) = \frac{4}{6} => \frac{2}{3}$$

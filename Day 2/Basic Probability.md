In a single toss of **2** fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be **at most 9**.

It will form a total of 36 combinations such as `(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), ... , (6, 6)`.

From this the sum more than 9 are eliminated. so it will be `30 / 36`

Ans : $$\frac{5}{6}$$

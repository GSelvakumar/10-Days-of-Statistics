In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and 
the two dice have a sum of 6.

Here also, same 36 combinations will occur from the two dices. 

The combinations that return the sum of 6 are `(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)`

Each die roll will be different so `(3, 3)` is eliminated. 

The final probability to find is `4 / 36`

Ans : $$\frac{1}{9}$$

There are 3 urns labeled X, Y and Z

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn,
2 are red and 1 is black ?

$$ Total = (\frac{4}{7} * \frac{5}{9} * \frac{4}{8}) + (\frac{4}{7} * \frac{4}{9} * \frac{4}{8}) + (\frac{3}{7} * \frac{5}{9} * \frac{4}{8})$$

$$ Total = \frac{10}{63} + \frac{8}{63} + \frac{5}{42} $$

Ans: $$ \frac{17}{42} $$
